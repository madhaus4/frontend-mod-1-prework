## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- In the Growth Mindset article - The S.M.A.R.T. goal setting tactic is new to me.  It's seems like a solid and reliable way to set goals.  
- What resonated with me is the idea that when you struggle, you are learning.  And just because you're struggling doesn't mean you're bad at that skill,
just that you're creating new knowledge.  When you struggle is when the growth mindset is most present.  I like what Carmen said "As long as you want to learn it, you will learn it".  Simple but I'm finding this true.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
The tactics that I demonstrate to show my Growth Mindset are through the belief that with practice and effort I can grow my coding skills, by seeking out challenges, and understanding that mistakes are a good process of learning.  These topics are ones that I feel I subconsciously take part in.   

The ways in which I don't validate my Grown Mindset as much are setting S.M.A.R.T. goals; I am working on being better at setting goals.  Usually, I keep goals in my head and not express them other way.  And focusing on the process is the other topic I would say I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset.  There have been times that I don't necessarily reflect on what I coded when I probably should have.  I need to take the time to reflect even if I feel like I'm in a time crunch.    

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Door Dash: Probably on the main screen in the app showing the list of places I
can order from.  

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is something that adds/removes/changes an element in an array.  

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to repeat the same or similar code however many times.  It allows you to print out data based on iterations of the same code.  When you use it with an array you can cycle through the elements in the array to change your output.  


6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is a continuous cycle.  It will keep going until a programmer gives it directions to stop.  The loop needs guidelines to follow.  The code dictates when to start and how many times to repeat.  


7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- What other kind of "updates" can be made to the index in a loop other than ++ and --?
