## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In regards to asking questions, I'm not super shy about embarrassing myself if I do have a dumb question.  Although, the fear of looking dumb has held me back from asking questions in my past.  I would say the older I get, the more vulnerable I am in asking questions.  

So far with coding, it may seem like I don't have many questions, but I think they're slow to develop sometimes - in terms of reflections.  I'm processing the content on this new endeavor so there are many questions floating in my brain; it just depends on when they become relevant.  


2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

All things considered, I think I did pretty well without those directions.  However, I did run into a road block running comparisons.js at first which I didn't have that problem in Session 1.  I reached out in Slack to get some clarification.  That helped as well as
reviewing my notes and googling.  Taking the training wheels off, so-to-speak, helped me
inch closer to better understanding how to find the solutions.


3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is when a block of code uses a true statement to output a
certain statement.  They use the keywords if/then/else.  
One example of this would be in the Garmin connect app, when I reach my sleep goal,
the code knows to put a check in the bottom corner of that box.  However, when I
don't reach that goal, the check mark does not appear.
And a daily life example is when I give my cat some pets, she is purring and happy.  And if she isn't getting that attention, she is a destroyer of things.  


4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement, you would add another line of code
with another condition and use the 'else if' keywords and just repeat that until the
code runs true.  Using curly braces to explain what you want the output to be if
the statement comes back true.  


5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

To check whether conditions of a statement have been met, you can use an if/else
statement and the return keyword.  You can also use console.log to check the
output as well.



6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I can't think of any questions.  I just need to practice more especially with
functions.  I struggled through the last YOU DO in functions.js where I needed to use 2 parameters to create a statement.  Once I made it successful, it seemed
like it should have made more sense to me out the gate which wasn't the case.
