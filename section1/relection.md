## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I enjoyed that the SuperLearner Article brought forward the realization that learning is a skill and you can get better at it just like anything else.  The article reminded me to be present in what I'm doing and to be mindful of improving.  Out of the 6 topics on the list, I would say I already do a few things but there's room for improvement definitely.  Firstly, I take care of my brain, I think; I eat healthy and read(good brain exercises).  I also view learning as a process, this is probably the more difficult one I do.  I can get into something and crave the knowledge to the point where I look past the process.  And in regards to teaching what I know, I'd say I do that.  Especially when the topic is something I'm passionate about, the passing of knowledge comes easy.  However, I am going to start doing more of adopting a growth mindset and taking more short breaks( this would have been helpful in my undergrad I'm sure).  


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
<ul>
  <li>String: contains letters, characters and numbers.</li>
  <li>Boolean: is either true or false.</li>
  <li>Integer: is any number; whole, negative, decimals.</li>
</ul>


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
var statement = "Hello World!";
console.log(statement);


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// is for a single line comment or deactivate a line of code
/*  */ is for a multiline comment or directions on what your code is doing


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a stored value.  Basically, the name of where you want something to be located.  


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
<h4>App: Kronos.</h4>
I use this for work; to access my schedule, to clock in an out for shifts and breaks, to correct missed punches, to request time off, and to view sick and pto accurals.
var hoursWorked = 40; (integer)
var username = "mdelsignore"; (string)
var clockedIn = true; (boolean)


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenate is to join together; by using data types to create a longer string.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
<h4>App: Starbucks.</h4>  
I think the developers use concatenation in the first header that reads "Good morning, Maria".  Also, when my reward status is displayed.  I'm sure something is concatenated, when I am collecting bonus stars for extra rewards as well.  It seems like it would be used quite frequently in the Starbucks app at least.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Is var one of the keywords I will mostly use in JavaScript? Or is it just that this is where we start off and there are many others that we add on?
